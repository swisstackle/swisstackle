- 👋 Hi, I’m Alain
- 👀 I’m interested in Math, Augmented/Virtual Reality and Algorithms. My end-goal is to work on Braincomputer interfaces that enable to enhance biomechanics and health (i.e Neuralink and downloadable biomechanics). I have a long way to go to be good enough to be able to do that though. 
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my BS in Computer Science (Spring 2022) and preparing for my math minor and masters.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity and Virtual Reality programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my latest project: An offensive line (virtual reality) simulator that helps young offensive linemen (American football) to enhance their awarness and reaction against defensive movement.
