 ** Authorized to work in the US and open for new opportunities. **

I am an C# Software Developer who is skilled at writing code at the backend and frontend level, as well as working in DevOps.

I also have a professional background in Blockchain Development, i.e with the Cosmos Blockchain Network and am interested in systematic trading.

In my freetime, I am a Biomechanics and Health nerd working hard to progress with my Functionalpatterns training (functionalpatterns.com).

During college, I played Division 1 football at the University at Buffalo.
