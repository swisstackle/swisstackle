* International division 1 student athlete (BSc Computer Science, minor in mathematics) from Switzerland who plans to stay in the United States after graduation.
* Received his one and only chance to play American football in the U.S in 2018 from New Mexico Military Institute
* Earned a full scholarship to the University at Buffalo three semesters later. Current starter on the offensive line.
* Looking for an internship for Spring 2023 or Summer 2023.
* Graduating Spring 2023.

Currently working on the following projects:

* Decentralized marketplace for football teams or companies (CSE426 class): Solidity, Truffle, ReactJS, NodeJS: The aim is to increase the amount of teamwork and teaching between coworkers or players. 
I came up with the idea that every player can create his own services or products that other players can buy with and only 
with tokens. That way, players are forced to contribute to the team because selling services is the only way 
to earn tokens, and having tokens is the only way to get help and teaching from others. It forces team
members to contribute to the organization
