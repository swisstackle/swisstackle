- 👋 Hi, I’m Alain
- 👀 I’m interested in Math, Augmented/Virtual Reality, Algorithms and Computer Vision. My end-goal is to work on Braincomputer interfaces that enable to enhance biomechanics and health (i.e Neuralink and downloadable biomechanics). I have a long way to go to be good enough to be able to do that though. 
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my BS in Computer Science (Spring 2022) and preparing for my math minor and masters.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity and Virtual Reality programming; As well as getting better at math so that my math minor goes smoothly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my latest project: An offensive line (virtual reality) simulator that helps young offensive linemen (American football) to enhance their awarness and reaction against defensive movement: https://github.com/users/swisstackle/projects/2

Current projects:

Future (big) project ideas:
 - Software to analyze gait cycle mechanics in a way that Functionl Patterns (functionalpatterns.com) does it (via Computer Vision)
 - Software for an Augmented Reality Headset and Smartphone to analyze Functional Patterns Exercises via Computer Vision to see if the exercise is being executed properly.
 These two projects out of scope, because I will have to study Computer Vision first; and before I study Computer Vision, I'll have to learn the math associated with it.   Fortunately my university has a good Computer Vision course.
 
 - Working for Neuralink and combining FunctionalPatterns with it. Longterm goal.
