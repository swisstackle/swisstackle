- 👋 Hi, I’m Alain
- 👀 I’m interested in Math, Augmented/Virtual Reality/Computer Vision, as well as Brain Computer Interfaces . My end-goal is to work on Braincomputer interfaces that enable to enhance biomechanics and health (i.e Neuralink and downloadable biomechanics). I have a long way to go to be good enough to be able to do that though. 
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing my BS in Computer Science (Spring 2022) and preparing for my math minor and masters.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity and Virtual Reality programming; As well as getting better at math so that my math minor goes smoothly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my latest project: An offensive line (virtual reality) simulator that helps young offensive linemen (American football) to enhance their awarness and reaction against defensive movement: https://github.com/users/swisstackle/projects/2

Current projects:

Future (big) project ideas:
 - Software to analyze gait cycle mechanics in a way that Functionl Patterns (functionalpatterns.com) does it (via Computer Vision).
 - Software for an Augmented Reality Headset and Smartphone to analyze Functional Patterns Exercises via Computer Vision to see if the exercise is being executed properly (Basically a Functional Patterns Personal Trainer)
 These two projects are out of scope currently, because I will have to study Computer Vision first; and before I study Computer Vision, I'll have to learn the math associated with it (i.e Linear Algebra and Probability Theory). Fortunately my university has a good Computer Vision course. 
 
 However, once I completed the necessary course work at my university, I will immediately tackle both projects. Both projects are very similar in nature and therefore can be developed simultanously without problems.
 
 - Working for Neuralink and combining FunctionalPatterns with it. Long-Long-Long term goal and highly dependend on how Neuralink develops in the near future. Im also hoping that when this technology matures (10-30 yrs down the road), that there will be some kind of programming API for it, so that I maybe not even have to work for Neuralink in order to combine Functional Patterns and Neuralink. But we'll see; it's all speculative.
